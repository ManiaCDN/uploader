Hello {{ recipient }}!

We have taken time to approve your recent upload.
Usually the time from upload until validation is less than 24 hours,
though we might need a bit longer sometimes.
Below you find a list of the files we have approved. If one of them
is not approved, it has likely violated the upload conditions.
You should receive another email concerning the issue in that case.
If you didn't, please answer to this email.
